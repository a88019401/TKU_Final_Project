00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:08.754
Do you practice basketball every day after school?

00:00:08.854 --> 00:00:10.262
Yes, I do. 

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:12.223
I'm on the basketball varsity team.

00:00:12.323 --> 00:00:17.470
I like basketball, but I can't play it every day.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.021
I am worried about my grades.

00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:22.422
I have many exams.

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:28.556
I play basketball every day and I also worry about my grades.

00:00:28.656 --> 00:00:30.037
Really? 

00:00:30.137 --> 00:00:34.771
Yes.  I can only read and prepare for exams at night.

00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:37.396
I don't have time to watch TV.

00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:41.000
I also don't have time to play video games.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.254
Wow, that must be hard work.

00:00:44.354 --> 00:00:46.158
Are you enjoying your life?

00:00:46.258 --> 00:00:49.685
Of course.  Basketball is my life.

00:00:58.785 --> 00:01:01.492
So what do you do on weekends?

00:01:01.592 --> 00:01:05.377
I read and watch basketball games with my friends.

00:01:05.477 --> 00:01:07.275
Me too. 

00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:12.432
Hey!  I have two tickets to the basketball game this Sunday.

00:01:12.532 --> 00:01:14.111
Let's go together. 

00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:17.514
Well, how much are the tickets?

00:01:17.614 --> 00:01:19.516
It's two hundred dollars.

00:01:19.616 --> 00:01:21.900
Do not worry.  Count me.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.900
So cool!  Thanks.
