00:00:00.294 --> 00:00:01.933
(in the classroom)

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:07.211
You're late again!

00:00:07.311 --> 00:00:08.522
I'm very sorry. 

00:00:08.622 --> 00:00:10.164
It's because of my brother.

00:00:10.264 --> 00:00:11.776
What do you mean?

00:00:11.876 --> 00:00:14.961
My brother and I share a bathroom.

00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:19.806
He uses it for almost an hour every morning.

00:00:19.906 --> 00:00:21.795
What is he doing there?

00:00:21.895 --> 00:00:27.064
He brushes his teeth, washes his face and showers.

00:00:27.164 --> 00:00:28.332
Wait a moment! 

00:00:28.432 --> 00:00:29.794
Take a shower? 

00:00:29.894 --> 00:00:32.352
Does he exercise in the morning?

00:00:32.452 --> 00:00:34.193
Yes, he is.

00:00:34.293 --> 00:00:36.528
He jogs every morning.

00:00:36.628 --> 00:00:41.126
Then he used the bathroom for almost an hour.

00:00:46.226 --> 00:00:47.339
I got it.

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:50.014
What time does he go to school?

00:00:50.114 --> 00:00:51.900
Seven o'clock sharp.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.677
He has class at eight o'clock.

00:00:54.777 --> 00:00:56.062
I know! 

00:00:56.162 --> 00:01:00.003
You can get up at five to use the bathroom.

00:01:00.103 --> 00:01:01.782
Oh, forget it.

00:01:01.882 --> 00:01:02.900
Forgive me.
