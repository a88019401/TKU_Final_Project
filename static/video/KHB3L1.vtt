Hey, Rita.

3
00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:07.200
I just checked your Instagram.

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.920
Did you go to Taitung this summer vacation?

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.500
Yes, I did.

6
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.100
My family and I visited my uncle there.

7
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.140
Cool!

8
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.020
Did you go to the beach?

9
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.760
Yes, we did.

10
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.400
The water there was blue and clean.

11
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.960
We went to the beach almost every day.

12
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.200
What else did you do there?

13
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.580
We went to a hot air balloon festival.

14
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.340
It was fun.

15
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.000
Nice.

16
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.720
What about you?

17
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.900
Did you enjoy your vacation?

18
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.920
Yes.

19
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.760
I went to Lukang and enjoyed my stay there.

20
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.120
Lukang?

21
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.000
What did you do there?

22
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.680
I joined a summer camp and
learned about the history of the town.

23
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.380
I shared old stories about the town with visitors at the temples.

24
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.420
You told stories about the town?

25
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.000
Thatâ€™s really interesting.
